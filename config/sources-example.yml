# config/sources-example.yml
# where to fetch data from

# what follows is the example definition of a source; you may define
# as many as you desire

# name
example_source:
  # under what username to publish the words
  user: foobar
  # a URL to a downloadable TSV or JSON file
  source: 'http(s)://example.com/my_dic'
  format: tsv | json
  # for TSV files: how many rows to skip before processing
  # this field can only be left empty in case of JSON files
  skip: 1
  # these patterns shape the definitions of words based on the
  # values of the columns found in the source file. 0-indexed.
  # with a column like: a\tb\tc\td\te\tf\t, these patterns would
  # produce two entries: 'a: b c!' and 'd: e is not f'
  # in case of JSON files, use numbers or field names; i.e., both
  # %(0) and %(english) is fine
  patterns:
    - head: '%(0)'
      body: '%(1) %(2)!'
    - head: '%(3)'
      body: '%(4) is not %(5)'
